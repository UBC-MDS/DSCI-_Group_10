Thank you for being interested in the project of big data!

The team project will involving big data. The purpose is to get exposure to working with large data sets, and explore how data load differently with different machines. More specifically, we will be building a machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia. The data set can be found on `figshare`. The data set we are using is around 6 GB. Additionally, the data will include features such as climate models, and the target actual rainfall observation. 

The ultimate goal is to build an ensemble model on these outputs and compare the results with the actual rainfall.
